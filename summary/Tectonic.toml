# A string identifying the location of the “bundle” of TeX support files
# underlying the processing of the document. The `tectonic -X new` command
# will populate this field with the current recommended default.
#
# This field should be a URL (a `.ttb` on the web, or a legacy indexed tar bundle),
# or a file on your computer (a `.ttb` or a legacy `.zip` bundle).
bundle = "https://data1.fullyjustified.net/tlextras-2022.0r0.tar"

# Extra search paths for TeX sources, images, etc.
#
# This is particularly useful if you have files used
# by multiple Tectonic documents. For example:
#
# repo-root/
#  ├── resources/
#  │   └── classes, images, other shared resources
#  ├── doc1/
#  │   ├── src/
#  │   └── Tectonic.toml  <-- Contains `extra_paths = ["../resources"]`
#  └── doc2/
#      ├── src/
#      └── Tectonic.toml  <-- Contains `extra_paths = ["../resources"]`


# One (of possibly many) output specifications.
[[output]]

# This output's name. By default, build products for each output will be
# placed in the build directory under subdirectory with this name.
name = "main"

# The output's type. Right now, only "pdf" is valid.
type = "pdf"

# The TeX "format" of preloaded macros to use when compiling the document.
# This is optional, with a default of "latex" (which corresponds to the
# standard LaTeX format). The exact set of formats that are supported will
# depend on the bundle that is being used.
tex_format = "latex"

# Whether the TeX “shell escape”, AKA `\write18`, mechanism is allowed.
# This is optional and defaults to false.
#
# Shell-escape is insecure, since it give the document access to your shell.
# It also is non-portable, because it requires your document to be built
# is run in an environment where a shell exists.
# Naturally, its use is strongly discouraged, but some packages depend on
# this feature.
shell_escape = false

# The working directory path to use for “shell escape”. The default is a
# temporary directory if `output.shell_escape` is true, else it's disabled.
# The path can be absolute or relative to the root file, but it must exist.
# Specifying this path automatically sets `output.shell_escape` to true.
# This is optional, and defaults to a temporary directory.
shell_escape_cwd = "string"

# Whether the synctex files will be created. This is optional and defaults to false.
synctex = true

# The input file we'll use to build this document,
# Given as a path relative to the `./src` directory.
#
# This may also be an array of file paths,
# the contents of which are concatenated while building.
# You could, for example, define:
# inputs = ["preamble.tex", "main.tex"]
#
# Finally, you may include an "inline" document as follows:
# inputs = [
#   { inline = "\\documentclass[a4paper]{article}" },
#   "main.tex"
# ]
# This will insert "\documentclass[a4paper]{article}" before main.tex
# (with a newline), allowing you to set options without making a new file.
